### **Chapter 4: Defining Non-Functional Requirements**
**Lab Title**: Specifying Non-Functional Requirements  
**Objective**: Write non-functional requirements that address performance and compliance.  
**Tasks**:  
1. Draft a non-functional requirement for GDPR compliance.  
2. Identify three potential scalability challenges and propose solutions as non-functional requirements.  
**Resources**: Non-functional requirements section, compliance guidelines.  
**Expected Outcomes**: Participants will create non-functional requirements addressing legal and technical challenges.

### **Chapter 5: Drafting the Specification Document**
**Lab Title**: Structuring a Specification Document  
**Objective**: Organize a comprehensive specification document.  
**Tasks**:  
1. Create an outline for a new feature (e.g., parent dashboard integration) using the structure from OpenEduConnect.  
2. Fill out at least one section of the outline in detail.  
**Resources**: Template for specification document structure.  
**Expected Outcomes**: Participants will understand how to structure and populate an IT specification.

### **Chapter 6: Verification and Validation**
**Lab Title**: Testing and Validation  
**Objective**: Develop test cases for functional and non-functional requirements.  
**Tasks**:  
1. Write a test case for validating the single sign-on (SSO) feature.  
2. Use a mock conformance test suite to verify a functional requirement.  
**Resources**: Test case templates, mock test suite.  
**Expected Outcomes**: Participants will demonstrate how to verify and validate specifications through structured testing.

### **Chapter 7: Documentation and Maintenance**
**Lab Title**: Creating User Documentation  
**Objective**: Develop user-friendly documentation and establish a version control strategy.  
**Tasks**:  
1. Write a sample user guide for setting up the Zoom integration in OpenEduConnect.  
2. Create a simple version control strategy, including naming conventions for specification updates.  
**Resources**: User guide template, version control guide.  
**Expected Outcomes**: Participants will produce clear documentation and plan for long-term maintenance.

### **Chapter 8: Course Recap and Next Steps**
**Lab Title**: Specification Review and Roadmap Creation  
**Objective**: Conduct a peer review and plan next steps for specification improvements.  
**Tasks**:  
1. Collaboratively review a section of the OpenEduConnect specification in small groups, providing constructive feedback.  
2. Create a roadmap for implementing feedback and preparing the specification for publication.  
**Resources**: OpenEduConnect specification, feedback form template.  
**Expected Outcomes**: Participants will refine their skills in reviewing and iterating on IT specifications.

### **Why These Labs Work**
1. **Practical Application**: Each lab builds on a real-world example, helping participants relate theory to practice.  
2. **Skill Development**: Labs progressively develop key skills, from planning to validation and maintenance.  
3. **Collaborative Learning**: Peer reviews and group discussions foster collaboration, mirroring workplace dynamics.  
4. **Comprehensive Coverage**: The labs cover every major aspect of IT specification development, ensuring well-rounded learning.  

This structure ensures participants leave the course with not just theoretical knowledge, but actionable skills applicable to real IT projects.
