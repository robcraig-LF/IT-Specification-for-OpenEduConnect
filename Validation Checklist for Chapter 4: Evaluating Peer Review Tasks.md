* Use this checklist to evaluate your peer review of IT specifications. 
* This checklist ensures you assess all critical aspects of a specification effectively and provide constructive feedback.

#### **Validation Checklist**
1. **Requirement Clarity**
   - ☐ Are the functional and non-functional requirements written clearly, avoiding ambiguity or technical jargon?
   - ☐ Do the requirements clearly state what the system should do (functional) and how it should perform (non-functional)?

2. **Alignment with Objectives**
   - ☐ Do the requirements align with the project’s stated goals and stakeholder needs?
   - ☐ Are any requirements misaligned with the purpose of the specification or unnecessary?

3. **Completeness**
   - ☐ Are all key areas (e.g., user roles, core features, compliance) covered adequately?
   - ☐ Are there any gaps in the specification that could hinder implementation?

4. **Measurability**
   - ☐ Are the requirements measurable or testable (e.g., “The system must process 1,000 concurrent users with 95% uptime”)?
   - ☐ Do the non-functional requirements include quantifiable metrics?

5. **Normative and Non-Normative References**
   - ☐ Are normative references (e.g., standards, regulations) correctly incorporated and relevant?
   - ☐ Are non-normative references (e.g., best practices) appropriately cited?

6. **Consistency**
   - ☐ Are the requirements consistent with each other, without contradictions or redundancies?
   - ☐ Do any terms or phrases require further explanation to avoid misinterpretation?

7. **Formatting and Organization**
   - ☐ Is the specification well-organized and easy to navigate?
   - ☐ Are headings, subheadings, and formatting used consistently?

8. **Constructive Feedback**
   - ☐ Does the review provide actionable feedback rather than vague or general comments?
   - ☐ Are suggestions phrased positively and geared toward improvement?
