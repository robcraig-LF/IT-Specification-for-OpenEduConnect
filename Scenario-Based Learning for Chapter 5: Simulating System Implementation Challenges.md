### Scenario-Based Learning for Chapter 5: Simulating System Implementation Challenges

#### **Lab Title**: Implementation Challenges in IT Specifications

### **Purpose of the Scenario**
This scenario encourages learners to:
- Adapt to unexpected challenges during implementation.
- Evaluate the impact of technical constraints on project goals.
- Document and communicate changes to maintain alignment with the specification.

---

### **Scenario Overview**
Learners are tasked with applying the **OpenEduConnect IT Specification** to a real-world implementation scenario. Midway through the lab, they encounter an undocumented API constraint, requiring them to adjust their implementation plan and resolve the issue while documenting the impact on the overall specification.

---

### **Initial Lab Instructions**
1. **Objective**:
   - Use the provided IT specification to outline steps for system implementation and testing.
   - Identify challenges in implementation and propose potential solutions.

2. **Tasks**:
   - Review the provided OpenEduConnect specification document.
   - Create an implementation plan for integrating the **Google Classroom API** to support assignment syncing.
   - Identify potential risks and challenges during implementation, based on the specification.

3. **Resources**:
   - OpenEduConnect specification document.
   - API documentation for Google Classroom (mock version provided).

### **Mid-Lab Dynamic Change: Undocumented API Constraint**
Midway through the lab, learners are presented with an unexpected challenge:

> **System Update**:  
> During the implementation process, it’s discovered that the **Google Classroom API** has a constraint not mentioned in the provided documentation:
>
> - **Constraint**: The API only allows syncing assignments with a maximum of five attachments. Assignments exceeding this limit fail to sync.  
>
> - **Impact**: The system must now accommodate this limitation while maintaining user expectations for larger assignments.

---

### **Updated Lab Instructions**
1. **Analyze the Constraint**:
   - Identify the sections of the specification impacted by this constraint (e.g., functional requirements, user expectations).
   - Consider whether the constraint is acceptable or if alternative APIs should be explored.

2. **Adjust the Implementation Plan**:
   - Modify the plan to include a workaround for the constraint, such as:
     - Limiting the number of attachments per assignment in the UI.
     - Providing an error message or alternative upload process for larger assignments.

3. **Propose Specification Revisions**:
   - Update the IT specification to reflect the new constraint. Include:
     - A revised functional requirement detailing the API limitation.
     - A note in the non-functional requirements addressing potential performance impacts.

4. **Justify the Changes**:
   - Write a short explanation discussing:
     - The trade-offs between accommodating the constraint and user expectations.
     - How the revised implementation aligns with project goals.

---

### **Expected Deliverables**
1. **Revised Implementation Plan**:
   - An updated step-by-step plan addressing the API constraint.
2. **Updated Specification**:
   - A revised functional requirement and non-functional note highlighting the constraint.
3. **Justification Document**:
   - A 2–3 paragraph explanation detailing the rationale for the changes.
