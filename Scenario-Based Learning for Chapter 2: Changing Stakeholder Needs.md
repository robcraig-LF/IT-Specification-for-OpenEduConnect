### **Mid-Lab Dynamic Change: New Stakeholder Introduction**
Midway through the lab, learners are presented with a message from a newly identified stakeholder:

> **New Stakeholder**:  
> **Role**: Parent Advocacy Group  
> **Needs**: The group represents parents who require improved parental dashboards for monitoring student progress, including features like weekly email summaries, attendance tracking, and direct messaging with teachers. They are particularly concerned about accessibility for parents with limited technical skills or internet access.
>
> **Impact on Project**: The group’s needs add a new dimension to the project, focusing on user-friendliness, accessibility, and communication features.

### **Updated Lab Instructions**
1. **Analyze the New Stakeholder’s Needs**:
   - Integrate the Parent Advocacy Group into the stakeholder analysis.
   - Identify how their needs impact the existing specification priorities.
   - Consider accessibility challenges and propose potential solutions.

2. **Revise the Research Plan**:
   - Adjust the plan to include research on accessibility standards (e.g., WCAG).
   - Add a new column to the benchmark table comparing parental dashboard features across platforms.

3. **Justify Your Revisions**:
   - Write a short justification explaining:
     - Why these changes are necessary.
     - How they align with the overall project goals.
     - Potential trade-offs or challenges introduced by these adjustments.

---

### **Expected Deliverables**
1. **Revised Stakeholder Analysis**:
   - Updated template including the Parent Advocacy Group’s needs and priorities.
2. **Enhanced Benchmark Table**:
   - New column comparing parental dashboard features across platforms.
3. **Justification Document**:
   - A 2–3 paragraph explanation of the revisions, addressing project alignment and potential challenges.
