### Rubric for Chapter 3: Evaluating Functional and Non-Functional Requirements

* This rubric allows you to evaluate your drafted functional and non-functional requirements based on clarity, specificity, and completeness.

#### **Evaluation Rubric**

| **Criteria**              | **Excellent (5)**                                                                                               | **Good (4)**                                                                      | **Satisfactory (3)**                                                             | **Needs Improvement (1-2)**                                                                                           |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Clarity**               | Requirements are unambiguous, easy to understand, and free from technical jargon.                              | Requirements are mostly clear, with minor ambiguity or technical language.         | Requirements are somewhat unclear or have multiple ambiguous phrases.            | Requirements are confusing, ambiguous, or include excessive technical jargon.                                        |
| **Specificity**           | Requirements provide precise details about expected functionality or performance metrics.                      | Requirements are detailed but may lack some precision in describing expected outcomes. | Requirements are somewhat general and lack sufficient details.                   | Requirements are vague or fail to specify expected outcomes clearly.                                                 |
| **Completeness**          | Requirements comprehensively cover all aspects of the feature or system.                                       | Requirements cover most key aspects, with minor gaps.                              | Requirements address some aspects but have noticeable omissions.                 | Requirements fail to cover major aspects or are incomplete.                                                          |
| **Measurability**         | Requirements include metrics or criteria that can be objectively tested (e.g., performance benchmarks).        | Requirements include measurable criteria, but they could be more specific.         | Requirements include limited or generic criteria for measurement.                | Requirements lack any measurable criteria, making them difficult to test.                                            |
| **Alignment**             | Requirements align perfectly with project goals and stakeholder expectations.                                  | Requirements align well with project goals, with minor deviations.                 | Requirements partially align with project goals but may miss stakeholder needs.  | Requirements do not align with project goals or stakeholder expectations.                                            |
| **Incorporation of Normative References** | Normative references are fully integrated, appropriate, and cited accurately.                            | Normative references are included but could be expanded or clarified.              | Normative references are partially included or lack proper integration.          | Normative references are missing or irrelevant.                                                                      |
