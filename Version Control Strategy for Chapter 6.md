### OpenEduConnect IT Specification: Version Control Strategy for Chapter 6

### Purpose of the Task
* This activity teaches learners how to evaluate version control strategies critically and adapt them to meet specific project requirements. 
* It emphasizes flexibility, traceability, and alignment with stakeholder needs.
---

### **Version Control Overview**
This strategy ensures that all changes to the **OpenEduConnect IT Specification** are traceable, maintainable, and collaborative, even for large, distributed teams.

---

### **1. Repository Structure**
- **Primary Repository**: 
  - **Name**: `OpenEduConnect-Specification`
  - **Platform**: GitHub
- **Branching Model**: **GitFlow**
  - **Main Branch**: Stable, approved versions of the specification.
  - **Development Branch**: For integrating approved changes before merging into the main branch.
  - **Feature Branches**: For individual contributors working on specific tasks (e.g., `feature-accessibility-requirements`).

---

### **2. Workflow**
1. **Creating a Feature Branch**:
   - All changes must begin with a feature branch named using the format:
     - `feature/<descriptive-name>`
     - Example: `feature/add-gdpr-compliance`.
   - Feature branches are based on the **development** branch.

2. **Pull Requests (PRs)**:
   - Contributors submit a PR from their feature branch to the **development** branch.
   - Each PR must include:
     - A description of the changes.
     - A link to the corresponding issue or task.
     - References to the sections of the specification being updated.

3. **Code Review**:
   - At least two reviewers must approve the PR.
   - Reviewers evaluate the following:
     - Compliance with normative references.
     - Consistency with project goals.
     - Clear and measurable requirements.

4. **Merging**:
   - Once approved, PRs are merged into the **development** branch.
   - Changes are validated for conformance and stability before merging into the **main** branch.

---

### **3. Versioning Scheme**
The project uses Semantic Versioning (SemVer):  
`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`  
- **MAJOR**: Incremented for significant changes that alter the structure or scope of the specification.
  - Example: Introducing a new compliance framework.
- **MINOR**: Incremented for new features or improvements that maintain backward compatibility.
  - Example: Adding detailed accessibility requirements.
- **PATCH**: Incremented for small updates, such as correcting typos or fixing inconsistencies.
  - Example: Fixing formatting in Section 3.2.

---

### **4. Documentation and Changelogs**
- **Changelog File**: Maintained in the repository (`CHANGELOG.md`).
  - Format:
    - **Version**: `1.2.0`
    - **Date**: `2025-02-01`
    - **Changes**:
      - Added GDPR compliance requirements to non-functional requirements.
      - Improved Section 2.1 to specify stakeholder input.

- **Commit Messages**: Follow a consistent format:
  - `[Type]: <Short Description>`
  - Example: `[Feature]: Add GDPR compliance to non-functional requirements`.

---

### **5. Backup and Maintenance**
- Weekly automated backups of the repository to a secure cloud server.
- Regular audits to identify and archive outdated branches.

---

### Learner Task: Critique or Adapt the Strategy
1. **Scenario**:  
   A new stakeholder requires frequent interim updates to the specification to ensure alignment with evolving regulatory standards. They have requested a separate review branch for these updates to avoid disrupting ongoing feature work.

2. **Critique Questions**:
   - Does this strategy adequately handle scenarios where frequent interim updates are necessary?
   - How might this workflow be adapted to introduce a **review branch** while minimizing disruptions?
   - Are there any risks or inefficiencies in the current branching model?

3. **Adaptation Task**:
   - Propose changes to the version control strategy to address the stakeholderâ€™s request.
   - Justify your changes and explain how they align with the project goals.
