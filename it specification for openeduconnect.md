**User Roles and Permissions**:
- **Students**: Access course material, participate in quizzes, and track progress.
- **Teachers**: Create and manage courses, grade submissions, and generate reports.
- **Admins**: Oversee user accounts, ensure compliance, and manage infrastructure.

**Integration APIs**:
- Google Classroom: Import/export assignments.
- Zoom: Schedule and host virtual classes.
- Kahoot: Synchronize quizzes and interactive activities.

**Core Features**:
- Centralized dashboard for personalized user experiences.
- Course management: creation, enrollment, and material uploads.
- Progress tracking with analytics and grading.

**User Interface**:
- Accessible and intuitive design.
- Responsive layout for mobile and desktop.

#### **3. Non-Functional Requirements**

- **Scalability**: Support up to 1 million active users during peak periods.
- **Performance**: Achieve 95% of page loads under 2 seconds.
- **Security**: Ensure data encryption, GDPR, and FERPA compliance.
- **Reliability**: 99.95% uptime guaranteed through load balancing and fault tolerance.

#### **4. System Architecture**

**Technology Stack**:
- **Frontend**: ReactJS.
- **Backend**: NodeJS.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (relational data), MongoDB (unstructured data).

**Architecture**:
- Microservices-based design with REST APIs.
- Authentication via OAuth 2.0.
- Load balancer and CDN for high availability.

*Note: Architectural diagrams and flowcharts will be included in the final document.*

#### **5. Normative References**

- **Standards**:
  - W3C Accessibility Guidelines.
  - OAuth 2.0 for authentication and session management.
- **Best Practices**:
  - API design following OpenAPI Specification.

#### **6. Stakeholder Input**

**Survey Results**:
- **Educators**: Prioritize ease of use, flexibility in course design, and cost efficiency.
- **Students**: Prefer an intuitive interface with mobile accessibility.

**Focus Group Insights**:
- Accessibility features such as screen readers and keyboard navigation are critical.
- Integration with existing school systems is a top priority.

#### **7. Licensing Considerations**

**Selected License**: MIT License  
**Rationale**: The MIT License was chosen for its balance between openness and contributor protection. This license supports widespread adoption by allowing modifications and redistribution, provided attribution is maintained.

**Strategic Alignment**: Open-source licensing, particularly with a permissive license like MIT, aligns with OpenEduConnect’s goals of promoting **interoperability**, **collaboration**, and **ecosystem growth**. It fosters community contributions and accelerates adoption in the educational technology landscape.

**International Considerations**: Since OpenEduConnect targets global adoption, its licensing terms comply with international intellectual property laws, ensuring enforceability across jurisdictions.  
**Contributor Agreement**: All contributors are required to sign an agreement clarifying the licensing of their contributions to reduce legal ambiguity and maintain consistent licensing across the project.

**Case Study: Licensing Impact on Ecosystem Development**  
The Apache 2.0 license used in Kubernetes enabled a robust ecosystem of interoperable tools and broad adoption across industries. Similarly, OpenEduConnect's MIT licensing strategy aims to replicate this success by encouraging widespread collaboration and innovation in educational technology.

#### **8. Version Control**

**Repository**: GitHub  
**Strategy**:
- **Branching Model**: GitFlow.
- **Workflow**:
  - Feature branches for new functionalities.
  - Pull requests reviewed by team leads.
  - Continuous Integration for automated testing.

#### **9. Verification and Validation**

**Test Cases**:
- **Functional Tests**: Validate API endpoints like user authentication.
- **Performance Tests**: Simulate high user loads using JMeter.

**Validation Process**:
- Peer review sessions to assess API design.
- Automated conformance checks using Swagger tools.

**Mock Scenario**:
- Verify integration of the Google Classroom API for assignment submissions.

#### **10. Maintenance and Documentation**

**Update Strategy**:
- Regular patch updates every quarter.
- Major version updates annually.

**Change Log**:
- Example: "Version 1.1.0: Added Zoom integration, fixed minor UI bugs."

**Documentation**:
- **API Docs**: REST API reference with examples.
- **User Manuals**: Step-by-step guides for each user role.

#### **11. Lab Exercises**

**Licensing and Ecosystem Exercise**:  
Analyze the impact of licensing on ecosystem growth.  
- **Scenario**: Compare the potential impact of adopting the MIT License versus a proprietary license on OpenEduConnect’s goals.  
- **Task**: Draft a licensing strategy addressing both community contributions and monetization goals.
