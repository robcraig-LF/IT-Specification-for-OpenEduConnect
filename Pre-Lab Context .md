---

### **Chapter 6: Documentation and Maintenance**
**Lab Title**: Version Control and Long-Term Maintenance  
**Pre-Lab Context**:  
"In this lab, you'll create a version control plan that ensures IT specification updates are traceable, organized, and compliant with industry standards. You'll also draft a strategy for maintaining the specification over its lifecycle."

---

### **Chapter 7: Case Studies and Practical Applications**
**Lab Title**: Critiquing and Improving an IT Specification  
**Pre-Lab Context**:  
"In this lab, you'll analyze a real-world IT specification to identify strengths, weaknesses, and areas for improvement. By applying best practices, you'll refine the document to meet high professional standards."

---

### **Chapter 8: Course Recap and Next Steps**
**Lab Title**: Drafting a Personal Action Plan  
**Pre-Lab Context**:  
"In this lab, you'll reflect on what you've learned throughout the course and create a personal action plan to apply these insights to your current or future projects. This exercise will help you bridge the gap between theory and real-world application."
