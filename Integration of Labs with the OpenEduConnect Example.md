Labs will use the **OpenEduConnect** IT specification example as a consistent, practical reference throughout the course to demonstrate how theoretical concepts translate into real-world applications. 
This approach ensures participants not only grasp the theoretical aspects of IT specifications but also gain practical, actionable skills to apply in real-world projects.
This is an example of how it can be effectively integrated into the labs:

### **Integration of Labs with the OpenEduConnect Example**

#### **Chapter 1: Introduction to IT Specifications**
**Lab Goal**: Familiarize participants with IT specifications and their role in projects.  
**Lab Activity**:  
- Analyze the OpenEduConnect project overview and objectives to identify the value of clear specifications.
- Discuss the importance of addressing functional and non-functional requirements using OpenEduConnect as a case study.  
**Purpose**: Establish a baseline understanding of why well-defined specifications are critical.

#### **Chapter 2: Planning and Research**
**Lab Goal**: Introduce research and planning techniques for specifications.  
**Lab Activity**:  
- Review the stakeholder input provided in the OpenEduConnect example.  
- Identify additional stakeholders and suggest new requirements based on their potential needs.
- Benchmark OpenEduConnect's proposed API integrations against comparable industry standards (e.g., Google Classroom or Zoom).  
**Purpose**: Show how research informs the initial stages of specification development.

#### **Chapter 3: Writing Functional Requirements**
**Lab Goal**: Help participants write precise functional requirements.  
**Lab Activity**:  
- Draft a new functional requirement for OpenEduConnect's dashboard feature, ensuring clarity and specificity.
- Critique one of the existing functional requirements in the example, identifying strengths and weaknesses.  
**Purpose**: Teach the nuances of writing functional requirements through practical application.

#### **Chapter 4: Defining Non-Functional Requirements**
**Lab Goal**: Familiarize participants with defining and incorporating non-functional requirements.  
**Lab Activity**:  
- Write non-functional requirements for OpenEduConnect's scalability and security based on the provided objectives.
- Discuss how GDPR and FERPA compliance would impact these requirements.  
**Purpose**: Highlight the importance of non-functional requirements in supporting system performance and compliance.

#### **Chapter 5: Drafting the Specification Document**
**Lab Goal**: Enable participants to structure and draft a comprehensive specification document.  
**Lab Activity**:  
- Use the provided sections of OpenEduConnect's IT specification as a guide to create a structured outline for a new feature (e.g., progress tracking).  
- Add missing elements or enhance an existing section, such as the "System Architecture."  
**Purpose**: Reinforce the value of clear organization and detail in specifications.

#### **Chapter 6: Verification and Validation**
**Lab Goal**: Introduce methods for testing and validating specifications.  
**Lab Activity**:  
- Develop a test case for OpenEduConnect's API authentication feature.
- Use a mock conformance test suite to validate the functional requirements for one of OpenEduConnect's API integrations.  
**Purpose**: Bridge the gap between specification writing and real-world implementation testing.

#### **Chapter 7: Documentation and Maintenance**
**Lab Goal**: Train participants to create user-friendly documentation and plan for long-term maintenance.  
**Lab Activity**:  
- Write an API documentation entry for one feature of OpenEduConnect, such as the Zoom integration.
- Develop a version control strategy for maintaining updates to the specification document.  
**Purpose**: Show the critical role of documentation in ensuring project longevity and usability.

#### **Chapter 8: Course Recap and Next Steps**
**Lab Goal**: Conduct a peer review and consolidate learning.  
**Lab Activity**:  
- Collaboratively review one section of OpenEduConnect's specification as a group, identifying areas for improvement.
- Create a roadmap for implementing feedback and advancing the specification.  
**Purpose**: Solidify the practical skills and knowledge gained during the course.

### **Benefits of Using OpenEduConnect in Labs**
1. **Consistency Across Modules**: The example ties together all aspects of the course, creating a cohesive learning experience.  
2. **Realistic Context**: OpenEduConnect mimics real-world scenarios, helping participants understand the practical relevance of the skills theyâ€™re acquiring.  
3. **Hands-On Learning**: Labs actively involve participants in writing, reviewing, and testing components of the example, fostering engagement and retention.  
4. **End-to-End Perspective**: By continuously working with the same project, learners see how individual elements (planning, requirements, testing, etc.) come together in a complete IT specification.
