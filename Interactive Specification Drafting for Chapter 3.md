### Interactive Specification Drafting for Chapter 3: Completing and Reviewing an IT Specification

---
### **Purpose**
This activity ensures learners:
- Practice drafting precise and measurable requirements.
- Develop skills in reviewing and refining IT specifications.
- Learn by comparing their work to examples that highlight best practices.

### **Scenario Overview**
Learners are presented with a partially completed IT specification for the **OpenEduConnect Project**. 
They are tasked with:
* Completing missing functional and non-functional requirements.
* Reviewing the existing sections for clarity and alignment with project goals.

**Detailed examples are provided after the task for learners to compare their work and refine their understanding of effective specification drafting.

### **Partially Completed IT Specification**

**1. Project Overview**:  
OpenEduConnect is a centralized educational platform designed to integrate various learning tools and resources. The platform must ensure accessibility, scalability, and compliance with GDPR and WCAG standards.

**2. Functional Requirements** (Partially Completed):  
| Requirement ID | Description                                                                                   |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| FR-01          | The platform must allow teachers to create, edit, and delete assignments.                     |
| FR-02          | The platform must enable students to submit assignments through a dedicated user dashboard.   |
| FR-03          | [MISSING]                                                                                   |
| FR-04          | The system must allow administrators to manage user accounts, including bulk user uploads.    |

**3. Non-Functional Requirements** (Partially Completed):  
| Requirement ID | Description                                                                                   |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| NFR-01         | The platform must achieve 95% uptime over any 30-day period.                                  |
| NFR-02         | The platform must ensure response times under 2 seconds for 95% of user requests.             |
| NFR-03         | The platform must comply with GDPR, including features for data subject requests.             |
| NFR-04         | [MISSING]                                                                                   |

### **Learner Tasks**
1. **Complete the Functional Requirements**:
   - Add **FR-03**:
     - A requirement addressing integration with third-party tools such as Google Classroom for syncing assignments.
   - Ensure the new requirement is:
     - Clear, measurable, and aligned with project goals.

2. **Complete the Non-Functional Requirements**:
   - Add **NFR-04**:
     - A requirement addressing system scalability to support up to 1 million concurrent users during peak periods.
   - Ensure the requirement includes specific metrics.

3. **Review Existing Sections**:
   - Evaluate the clarity of the existing functional and non-functional requirements.
   - Identify any ambiguities or inconsistencies.
   - Suggest revisions to improve alignment with project objectives.

### **Expected Learner Outputs**
1. **Completed Functional and Non-Functional Requirements**:
   - **FR-03**: "The platform must integrate with Google Classroom to sync assignments, ensuring updates are reflected in real-time within the platform."
   - **NFR-04**: "The platform must support up to 1 million concurrent users with no more than a 5% degradation in performance during peak periods."

2. **Revised Functional Requirements**:
   - Suggestion for FR-01: "The platform must allow teachers to create, edit, and delete assignments, including adding deadlines and attachments."
   - Suggestion for FR-02: "The platform must enable students to submit assignments through a dedicated user dashboard, with confirmation of successful submission."

3. **Revised Non-Functional Requirements**:
   - Suggestion for NFR-01: "The platform must achieve 95% uptime, with outages not exceeding 1 hour in any 7-day period."
   - Suggestion for NFR-03: "The platform must comply with GDPR, providing users with tools to manage data subject requests, including data access, rectification, and deletion."

### **Feedback Element: Examples for Comparison**

**Example Functional Requirement (FR-03)**:
- **Weak Example**: "The platform must sync assignments with Google Classroom."
- **Strong Example**: "The platform must integrate with Google Classroom, syncing assignments within 30 seconds of updates and providing error notifications for failed syncs."

**Example Non-Functional Requirement (NFR-04)**:
- **Weak Example**: "The platform must be scalable."
- **Strong Example**: "The platform must support up to 1 million concurrent users, maintaining an average response time of less than 3 seconds during peak load."

### **Reflection Task**
1. Compare your completed requirements with the provided examples.
2. Reflect on:
   - The clarity and specificity of your requirements.
   - How well your requirements align with the projectâ€™s goals.
3. Revise your requirements as needed based on the feedback examples.
